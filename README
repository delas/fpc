FPC README FILE
===============

In order to run FPC, you have to execure the file fpc in the same place of this
readme file. Be sure that fpc has executing privilege and that data/archive.db
has read/write privilege.

You shall also crate a symbolic link to fpc and giving it executing privilege,
using:
	# ln -s THIS-README-PATH/fpc /usr/bin/fpc
	# chmod +x 

Remember also to modify the fpc script, replacing "path/to/directory" with the
current working directory.
